# Flashcard-O-Matic

## Description

This project served as an opportunity to integrate React Router API with JavaScript logic.
The application built allows for the creation, modification, and utilization of text flashcards to aid in studying.

The main goal of the project was to practice and improve my skills in integrating React Router, a popular library for client-side routing, with JavaScript logic to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

Additionally, the application allows users to create flashcards to help them study any subject they are interested in, making it a useful tool for students, professionals or anyone who wants to improve their knowledge.

The flashcard feature also allows users to modify and delete existing flashcards, making it a versatile tool to manage different types of flashcards.

Overall, the project provided an opportunity to improve my skills in building dynamic and interactive web applications using React Router.
